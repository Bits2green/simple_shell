This is a Simple Shell project by Vincent Mwaura and Moses Catona.

The aim of the project is to recreate the Linux shell with basic functionalities including:

- Displaying Prompt ($);
- Receiving User Input;
- Parsing User Input;
- Executing User Input;
- Searching for and Executing commands using the correct PATHs;

We hope you find this repository helpful in the future.

Cheers!
